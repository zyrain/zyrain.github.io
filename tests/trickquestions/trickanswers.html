So, you managed to sweet talk the answers out of me.  Here ya go.
<PRE>
1.We'll start easy with this popular OK Cupid! compatibility question: If the price of an apple was raised 50% and then decreased 50%, making it cost $0.75, how much was the original price?
  $0.50	 
  $0.75	 
* $1.00 
  $1.25	 

Explanation: The trick here is that when the price is decreased you're
also losing half of your increase, not just half of the original value.
  x * 1.5 * 0.5 = 0.75
  x * 0.75 = 0.75
  x = 1

2.Now, say you test positive for a disease that affects 1 in 100 people. The test is 99% accurate. What is the chance you have the disease?
  100% - I tested positive, didn't it?
  99% - Duh, you just TOLD me it's 99% accurate
  1% - Duh, you just TOLD me it affects 1 in 100 people!
* 50% - Either I do, or I don't

The trick here is that any test gives false positives (saying you have it,
when you do not).  Since there are 100 times as many people who do not have 
the disease as those that do, that's 100 times as many chances for the test to screw up.  For example if we look at a population of 10,000 people:
100 will have the disease
9900 will not have it.
If you test the 100 that have it, 99 will test positive, 1 will falsely test negative
If you test the 9900 that do not have it, 9801 will correctly test negative (99%), but 99 will falsely test positive.
Since there are just as many true positives as false positives your odds of
having it are 50%.

3.A man points to a photograph and says, "Brothers and sisters have I none, but this man's father is my father's son." To whom is he pointing?
  His father
  Himself 
* His son  
  His father's brother's nephew's cousin's former roomate

Explanation: 
 this man's father = my father's son
 this man's father = me (since I have no brothers)
 I am this man's father.
 This man is my son

4.You're on a game show in front of three doors. Behind one of them is a prize. After choosing one, the host, to build suspense, opens one of the remaining two doors showing it to be devoid of said prize. He then asks you if you want to change your mind. Should you?
* Yes - my odds are better if I now switch doors
  No - my odds are better if I keep my current choice
  It doesn't matter, the odds are the same either way
  I just like to choosing the meaningless but funny 4th choice

Explanation: It's clear that on you initial guess, your chances of choosing
correctly are 1 in 3.  However, if you choose an empty door to start with (2/3
chance), then the host is forced to open the other empty door for this
trick to work, he doesn't get a choice.  It's only when you initially chose
the prize door that switching is bad.

NOTE: For those of you that are concerned that the question doesn't explicitly
state that the host is forced to open an empty one with foreknowledge, if you happened to survive, and just got lucky that the host didn't just show you the prize door and laugh at you, then switching won't hurt your odds, but if he was forced to reveal the empty one, switching would double your odds, so the correct answer is thus STILL to switch.

5.Okay, doors again, but with higher stakes. You're in a Roman arena, and the King has given you the choice of two doors. Behind one is a beautiful lady, (or man, if that's your preference) who will have dinner with you. Behind the other is tiger who will surely have you for dinner too. In front of each door is a guard who knows what's behind it, but one of the guards will lie to you, and the other will tell the truth. With a single question to only one of the guards, is it possible to know which door to choose?
  No, This is wholly impossible
  No, One question can tell me who the liar is, but I won't know which door to choose without a second question
* Yes. For I am a master logician!
  If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice!

Explanation:  Ask either guard "What would the other say if I were to ask him where the lady is?"  Then go into the other door.

4 possibilities: T(ruth) L(iar) +(Lady) -(Tiger) You in front of one of these combinations
T- : Answer: This door (truthfully relating the lie)
L- : Answer: This door (lying about the truth teller saying it's the other one)
T+ : Answer: The other door (truthfully relating the lie)
L+ : Answer: The other door (lying about the truth teller saying this door)


6.Okay, grammar time. Is it correct that seven and five is thirteen or seven and five are thirteen?
  Seven and five is thirteen 
  Seven and five are thirteen
  Seven plus five equals thirteen
* No. 1	

Explanation: 7+5 = 12, making neither side correct, and logically, False OR False = False

7.A train leaves Philadelphia heading to New York at 12:00pm. Another train leaves New York heading to Philadelphia at 12:05pm. Which one will be closer to New York when the trains cross each other?
  The 12:00 train to NY
  The 12:05 train to Philly
* Neither - They'll be the same distance away
  Neither - The trains will not cross

Explanation: When the train cross they will by definition be in the same place (else they wouldn't be crossing at that moment), so they're the same distance away.

8.As I was going to St. Ives, I met a man with seven wives. Every wife had seven sacks, every sack had seven cats, every cat had seven kitts. Kitts, cats, sacks, wives, how many were going to St. Ives?
  2080
  2081 
  2401
* None of the above

Explanation: The trick here is that assuming constant movement rates, one only meets travelers coming the opposite direction, thus, none of the Kits, cats, sacks, or wives, or the man he met are going to St. Ives, only "I" am going there, so the answer is 1 (None of the above).

9.(Note: I didn't like old question 9, this one is better) If you take a regular piece of paper and fold it in half, it gets a little thicker. If you were to do this 20 times, approximately how thick would the paper be?
  As thick as a housefly
  As thick as a loaf of bread
  All the way up to the ceiling
* As tall as a skyscraper

Explanation: when you fold the paper in half, you double its thickness.  The
thickness of paper is approximately 0.1mm (0.004 inches).  So:
0.1mm * 2^20 = 105m
0.004in * 2^20 = 334ft

NOTE: The question says "if you were to do this" this phrasing assumes it's possible.  Secondly, if you think it's NOT possible, you're mistaken.  One just needs a bigger piece of paper.  See this link:
</PRE><a href="http://pomonahistorical.org/12times.htm">Further Explanation</a><PRE> That woman has done it 12 times and done the math to show how big the paper would need to be for it to be done any number of times.

10.(New internationalized question) If pineapples are worth $2 each, and oranges are worth $1 each, which is worth more: a barrel of oranges or half a barrel of pineapples?
  The pineapples
* The oranges
  They're the same
  Thank goodness this test is over!

Explanation:  Since oranges are smaller than pineapples, you can fit more
into the barrel.  Let's say that you can fit 100 oranges into a barrel but
only 50 pinapples.  A full barrel or oranges is worth 100*$1 = $100, while
half a barrel of pineapples is worth 1/2 * 50 * $2 = $50
