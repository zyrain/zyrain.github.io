I'd rather study
arts & crafts
literature & humanities
business & finance
science & engineering
I feel best about myself when
I'm graceful in action
I'm en rapport with someone
I'm rock-solid dependable
I exercise my ingenuity
In mood I'm more often
excited & stimulated
enthusiastic & inspired
cautious & prudent
calm & detached
I keep coming back to
perfecting my craft
helping others affirm themselves
helping others do right
figuring out how things work
Coming right down to it I tend to be
practical & opportunistic
compassionate & altruistic
dutiful & diligent
efficient & pragmatic
I respect myself more for
being bold & adventurous
being kind-hearted & of good will
doing good deeds
being autonomous & independent
I'm more inclined to trust
impulses & whims
intuitions & intimations
customs & traditions
pure reason & formal logic
I'm sometimes eager to
make an impression & have impact
lose myself in romantic dreams
be a valued & legitimate member
make a scientific breakthrough
I'm in a life-long search for more
thrills & adventures
self-understanding
safety & security
efficient methods of operation
In facing the future
I bet something lucky will turn up
I believe in people's innate goodness
you just can't be too careful
it's best to keep a wary eye
If it were possible I'd like to become
an artistic virtuoso
a wise prophet
a chief executive
a technological genius
I'd do best in a job working with
tools & equipment
human resources development
materiel & services
systems & structures
As a guide to action I look primarily at
immediate advantages
future possibilities
past experience
necessary & sufficient conditions
I'm most self-confident when I'm
adaptable & flexible
genuine & authentic
honorable & respectable
strong-willed & resolute
I appreciate it when others
surprise me with generosity
recognize my true self
express their gratitude
ask me for my rationale
When thinking about misfortune
I usually laugh it off
I often wonder why
I try to make the best of it
I view it from a wide perspective
