<p><i>During times of crisis, God is with us, so they say<br>
But when the path diverges, who is to say<br>
That the path of truth is this way<br>
And the path of darkness this other way?</i></p>
<p><i>During times of crisis, an Angel is sent, to light our way<br>
Seeing her, following her, knowing her, to be true<br>
This is a very difficult thing to do<br>
For the devil's path, all too often, also looks true</i></p>
<p><i>It is time, to ignore my rhyme.&nbsp; Chaotic.<br>
This is the way of paths and crisis<br>
The heart is no guide, despite understanding<br>
The mind of no comfort</i></p>
<p><i>Can conviction be found in another?</i></p>
<p><i>The Devil speaks of promises.&nbsp; The Angel, of wisdom.<br>
Why do we want to turn back down the path?<br>
Shunning either choice is the worst of any.</i></p>
<p><i>Why is it so hard to be good?<br>
Why is the way not clear?<br>
Is the struggle part of the magic?</i></p>
<p><i>Are the gates of heaven open only to those who choose right?<br>
Or is aiming to choose right enough?<br>
Or even merely choosing?<br>
Or to just the lucky few who stumble upon them?</i></p>
