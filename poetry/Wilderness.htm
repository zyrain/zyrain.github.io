<p><i>

fans whine, wings beat<br>
frogs croak, chairs creak<br>
AC hums, wind blows<br>
waves lap, buttons click<br>
music plays, birds sing<br>
crickets chirp, phones ring<br>
doors slam, lambs bleat<br>
leaves rustle, computers beep</i></p>
<p><i>A wilderness of our own design</i></p>
<p>This was one of my first pieces.&nbsp; I rather dislike the disjoint sound to
it, but I suppose free form poetry need not sound nice.&nbsp; I came up with the
idea while sitting in a cubicle (big surprise).&nbsp; Perhaps I'll work another
piece in the future along the same theme, but actually make it rhyme or
something.</p>
