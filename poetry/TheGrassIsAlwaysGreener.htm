<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC9900">The Grass is Always Greener<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p><i>They say grass is always greener<br>
On the other side<br>
And nothing's ever better<br>
Than what we've left behind<br>
The days are getting shorter<br>
The air has grown so cold<br>
But if you will excuse me<br>
If I could be so bold</i></p>
<p><i>I'd like to take exception<br>
To life's unwav'ring rule<br>
And point out an example<br>
Though I might be a fool<br>
There is a girl named Robin<br>
It's really no small thing<br>
For everybody knows<br>
Robins foretell Spring</i></p>
<p><i>Springtime means life changes<br>
The days will soon grow long<br>
And as the air gets warmer<br>
My heart will fill with song<br>
The past will stay behind me<br>
I'm sure that you'll agree<br>
When summer is upon me<br>
A greener place it'll be</i></p>
