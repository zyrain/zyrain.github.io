<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC9900">The Little Butterfly<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p><i>I want to see this and go over there<br>
Fluttering by without even a care<br>
I land on a flower to rest my wings<br>
Flowers are always such beautiful things<br>
Now back over here, and again over there<br>
Thanks to my wings I fly through the air<br>
And land once again so that all bugs can see<br>
I'm the prettiest bug as there ever can be</i></p>
<p>I like the rhyme and meter in this work.&nbsp; It's one of my few that needs
to be read to catch the fully effect, but most people can pick up on it after a
reading or two.&nbsp; I intend a slight speed increase after the first line and
a slow down again for the last two lines.</p>
