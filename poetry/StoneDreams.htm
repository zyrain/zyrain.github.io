<i><p>The stones of the earth are but hardened hearts<br>
Preserved through loss of love<br>
Flames burn and die, but coldness endures</p>

We all can feel it<br>
Every day a little colder, a little dimmer<br>
But we still dream -- every stone dreams</p>

Asleep, we remember<br>
The heart that was once is again, pulsing and warm<br>
The love, the pain, both felt as intensely as ever</p>

The contrast is striking<br>
In death it is the stone face of grief<br>
In age it is the chill of bones</p>

These stones, each still haunted upon awakening<br>
By the black horse or fading light of hope<br>
Dreams are immune to the enervation of time</p></i>
