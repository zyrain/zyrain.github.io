<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC9900">Improvised Xmas Poem 2009<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p><i>
Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
<br> 
No stockings were hung, the trees were all bare, no sign that Santa Clause should ever go there.
<br> 
On facebook, he'll find purchase, that feeling he will tap, exuding Christmas joy via computer on his lap.
<br> 
Here Neal lied, all snug in his bed; an improvised poem springs out of his head.
<br> 
Then on the task bar, did arose such a clatter. A blinking warning that something was the matter. 
<br> 
I clicked the icon with ultimate care, dreading what might be written on there.
<br> 
It's just java I found, and sighed with relief. An update most urgent, the message was brief.
<br> 
But then what to my wandering eyes did appear? But a security icon, UAC needed here. 
<br> 
With almost no thought, I almost did click, but then thought to myself, no wait, this is a trick!
<br> 
Suspecting a trojan, I searched quite in vain, for the offending download from which it came. 
<br> 
Not Dozer, Conficker, Torpig, or Storm, what is your name you nefarious worm?
<br> 
Just then I remembered, I'd forgotten my wall. Koobface is the virus dreaded by all! 
<br> 
Knowing my quarry, now I must try, to kill it at once, it forever must die!
<br> 
A scanner at once did I download, this once had a icon shaped like a toad! 
<br> 
It chirped and it beeped then said with a smile, your system's been fine all this long while.
<br> 
Another, another, and more did I try, but each said the same, sorry tough guy.
<br> 
Growing quite desperate, I doubted myself, I googled, and googled, till I saw an elf!
<br> 
The elf dressed in green, with pointy bell toes, with caption it said "I fix all worm woes!"
<br> 
The network was slowing, the koob gaining power, I knew I must stop him within this last hour!
<br> 
I clicked on the URL and awaited my fate. I prayed that that elfy would not be too late!
<br> 
Once loaded, I did see, a battle ensue. Oh no, NOT THAT, twas a SCREEN ALL OF BLUE!
<br> 
My hard disk, my files, I'd lost all my work. God damn that Bill Gates is a horrible jerk.
<br> 
Then out of my speakers a laughter so cute. It sounded as I'd have imaged a newt. 
<br> 
The screen turned now to an image of smoke. The blue screen was nothing but a naughty elf joke.
<br> 
He came on and said that my files were all fine, and warned me to take better precautions next time.
<br> 
Left a note on my wall ere he vanished from sight: "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"

On a whim I decided to create this improvised poem in real time on facebook on Christmas Eve 2009.  I posted line by line and at least two people enjoyed the experience.  In that way, it was rather like a live performance!
