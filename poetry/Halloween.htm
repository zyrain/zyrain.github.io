<p><i>On Halloween, the witches ride,<br>
with black cats and pumpkin pie.<br>
The ghosts arise from their beds<br>
For today they are the un-dead.<br>
Tricks and Treats are all around.<br>
People everywhere, party bound.<br>
But none dare speak of their fright<br>
at seeing the dead walk this night.<br>
For in the morning all is gone<br>
Washed away by the rising sun.</i></p>

<p>This was my first ever piece of poetry. I wrote it as an assignment in the
fourth grade when I was only eight years old.&nbsp; It actually received a
failing grade because my teacher didn't believe that I had written it; I swear I
didn't get help from my mother!</p>
