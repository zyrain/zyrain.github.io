<p><i>So common their differences, yet different their commonness<br>
Two lovers blazing a trail walked many times before<br>
The destination unknown, the journey certain<br>
The way, perilous, fraught with Hopes, Dreams, Desires<br>
Will they be lost?  Found?  Saved?  Forgiven?<br>
For each guidance found only in the other</i></p>
<p>This is a recent love angst poem.&nbsp; I like it because it is layered (like
an onion) and I'm not sure even I have discovered all it has to tell.</p>
