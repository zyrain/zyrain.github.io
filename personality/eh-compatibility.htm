			<P>Social Orientation describes how much of your behavior is motivated by the desire to get along with and be liked by other people, as well as how much is driven by the desire to be seen as an effective problem solver who is self sufficient. People with a strong External Orientation place a high value on communicating their thoughts and feelings with other people. People with a strong Internal Orientation place a high value on individual effectiveness, competence and autonomy. The dimensions that we assess as part of your Social Orientation are Conflict Management, Character, Vitality and Security, Communication Style, Kindness and Autonomy.</P>

			<P><STRONG>Based on your profile, you are most compatible with women who fit the following descriptions:</STRONG></P>
			<UL>
				
					
					<B>Communication: </B>You will have the best relationship with a woman who believes easy conversation is essential to a good relationship. She&#39;s comfortable speaking her mind, but she also sees the importance of listening to someone else&#39;s point of view. Friends and family appreciate her ability to listen and speak with candor. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Character: </B>Your ideal mate isn&#39;t going to let other people&#39;s misfortunes get her down. Yes, homeless people need help and charities do lots of good work, but that&#39;s not necessarily anything that concerns her. She takes care of herself and won&#39;t feel the need to try and solve all your problems. Your relationship will be based more on mutual respect than a need for emotional support.
				
			</UL>

			<P><STRONG>Some additional details about your ideal mate:</STRONG></P>
			<UL>
				
					
					<B>Kindness: </B>You and your ideal mate are generally independent. She doesn&#39;t need you to shower her with praise and presents. She&#39;s the kind of person who will be able to understand oversights, like a missed anniversary or showing up late for a date. She has a thick skin. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Autonomy: </B>You will be best matched with someone who doesn&#39;t think you need to know everything about each other. She likes spending time with friends but doesn&#39;t need to check up on them every day. Her friends describe her as the kind of person who&#39;d rather wait for someone to volunteer information instead of trying to pry details out.
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Vitality and Security: </B>You will be most compatible with a woman is comfortable with a future that&#39;s somewhat undefined. She&#39;s self-reliant and isn&#39;t looking for emotional support. Friends see her as someone who isn&#39;t looking to be rescued; she can take care of herself. She generally focuses on short-term goals rather than things that are years down the road. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Conflict Resolution: </B>You&#39;ll be happiest in the long run with a woman who knows that sometimes it&#39;s important to fight to win. Making peace sometimes isn&#39;t worth giving up her advantage. If she&#39;s right, she&#39;ll stand her ground, even if it means the argument will get more heated.

			<P>The Extraversion scale assesses how you feel when you are around people. Extroverts are generally comfortable at the center of attention.  They rarely feel a need for &quot;alone time&quot; and are almost always eager to meet new people.  Introverts, on the other hand, avoid the spotlight when they can, approach many social gatherings with hesitation, and relish time spent with good friends whom they know well.  While most people exhibit a mix of Introvert and Extrovert qualities based on what kind of social situation they are in, people who are strongly Extroverted often place the largest value on having many friends and making new friends easily.  In contrast, people who are strongly Introverted generally place the highest value on having a few very deep and meaningful friendships.

The dimensions of your profile which are associated with Extraversion are Emotional Energy, Sociability, Adaptability, Humor, Romantic Passion and Dominance.</P>

			<P><STRONG>Based on your profile, you are most compatible with women who fit the following descriptions:</STRONG></P>
			<UL>
				
					
					<B>Humor: </B>Your ideal mate is the kind of woman who is funny and interesting. Sometimes, she likes telling jokes and making people laugh with things like one-liners or satirical observations about friends and family. But she doesn&#39;t need to be a constant one-woman show. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Adaptability: </B>Your ideal mate likes to find new ways to deal with old challenges. She can think up creative solutions to a problem but doesn&#39;t discount the tried-and-true answers. She&#39;s the kind of person who can never seem to do something the same way twice. She can accept new approaches to problems when the old solutions have stopped working.  
				
			</UL>

			<P><STRONG>Some additional details about your ideal mate:</STRONG></P>
			<UL>
				
					
					<B>Emotional Energy: </B>You&#39;ll be happiest with someone who understands that you sometimes need downtime to recharge. She likes being a spectator, whether it&#39;s watching sports or just people-watching at an airport. She&#39;s not the kind of person who always has a list of things she wants to accomplish in a day.
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Romantic Passion: </B>Your ideal mate is a sensual person who enjoys occasional romantic gestures like a night of soft music, candles and good conversation. But she doesn&#39;t overemphasize romance or put unrealistic expectations on her partner. She knows there are more important things in a relationship. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Dominance: </B>You are best suited to someone who doesn&#39;t take competition to extremes. She likes to win but doesn&#39;t need to do so at all costs. She is aggressive when the situation warrants it, such as when vying for a promotion or playing tennis in front of a crowd, but can accept a loss with grace. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Sociability: </B>You&#39;ll be happiest with a woman who doesn&#39;t go out of her way to meet new people. She&#39;s the kind of person who will wait for others to introduce themselves to her. She tends to avoid large parties where she doesn&#39;t know anyone. She&#39;s not all that fond of mingling, instead preferring time spent with close friends.

			<P>Openness refers to a person&#39;s willingness to experience new and creative ideas. People who score low on Openness tend to place a high value on tradition and belonging to a group. People who score high on Openness tend to place a high value on imagination and individualism. Extreme scores on Openness also often distinguish between people who enjoy thinking in symbols and abstractions to people who prefer ideas which are clear and concrete. The dimensions of your profile that we consider as part of Openness are Artistic Passion, Curiosity and Intellect.</P>

			<P><STRONG>Based on your profile, you are most compatible with women who fit the following descriptions:</STRONG></P>
			<UL>
				
					
					<B>Intellect: </B>Your ideal mate is smart, educated and knowledgeable. She is astute and has varied interests in subjects such as literature or languages. Other people see her as someone who&#39;s looking for friends who are her equal in terms of intelligence or knowledge. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Curiosity: </B>You will be well matched with a woman who likes to understand the world around her. She&#39;s generally inquisitive and knowledgeable about subjects that pertain to her life, whether she&#39;s a politics junkie or a baseball fan. If she&#39;s not interested in an issue, she probably won&#39;t feel compelled to read up on it just to expand her knowledge. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Artistic Passion: </B>You are best suited to the kind of woman who can appreciate others&#39; creativity. She likes art galleries but probably doesn&#39;t get to them very often. She likes things like literature and fine art but probably spends her spare time on other pursuits. It&#39;s possible she would visit some of the world&#39;s top museums while on vacation but then neglect the ones in her hometown.

			<P>Physicality separates people who enjoy being physically energetic and active from those who are uncomfortable or dislike engaging in sports or strenuous activity.  Some people push life to the limit, scaling mountains or competing in triathlons. People with a less demanding sense of Physicality enjoy looking at mountains more than climbing them. 

The dimensions of your profile which compose the most important aspects of your Physicality are Appearance, Physical Energy and Sexual Passion.</P>

			<P><STRONG>Based on your profile, you are most compatible with women who fit the following descriptions:</STRONG></P>
			<UL>
				
					
					<B>Sexual Passion: </B>Your ideal companion is looking for the surge of physical excitement that comes with falling in love. When she&#39;s with her partner, she expects a physical connection that goes beyond compatible personalities and interests. Physical chemistry isn&#39;t her only need, or even her main one, but she does want to feel a strong desire for her partner.  
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Appearance: </B>You are most compatible with a woman who wants to look good but doesn&#39;t obsess over it.

					<B>Physical Energy: </B>You are best suited to someone who likes to stay active but also enjoys spending quiet time at home. She makes staying healthy and exercising a normal part of her life, but she also enjoys kicking back and relaxing when the time is right.

			<P>Goal Orientation refers to the drive to plan for the future versus the urge to live in the moment. People who score low on Goal Orientation are generally spontaneous and free spirited.  They are likely to act on their first impulse and worry about the consequences afterwards and place a high value on being clever and lucky.  People who score high on Goal Orientation, on the other hand, are more driven to think about future consequences before acting, place a high value on being wise and cautious, and like to always put their best foot forward.

					<B>Education: </B>Your ideal mate is a woman who wants her partner to be her intellectual equal. She&#39;s passionate about ideas, so she is looking for someone who is interested in discussing things like religion, politics, ethics or science. If a man is unable to converse intellectually, she generally loses interest.

					<B>Ambition: </B>Your ideal mate is the kind of person who strives to be the best at what she does. She understands your desire to be recognized for your accomplishments.

She likes to stay busy, but she doesn&#39;t need to fill every moment of every day with some task or chore. She&#39;s generally efficient, persistent and productive, but she doesn&#39;t obsess over making lists of things to do or accomplish. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Organization: </B>Your ideal mate is the type of person who keeps her home neat and clean, without being obsessive about it. She likes to be structured at home, and make sure everything has its place. But she won&#39;t look down on you if you kick off your shoes and don&#39;t straighten them at the door. She&#39;s good at creating a home that&#39;s comfortable and welcoming, the perfect place to relax.

			<P>While day-to-day events play a major role in our feelings, there are deep-seated patterns of emotion that underlie our personality and stretch across the span of our lives. These patterns are considered your Emotional Temperament.

People who score low on Emotional Temperament are more likely to experience feelings such as anxiety, anger and depression on a regular basis.

			<P>Many significant ingredients, like upbringing, family goals and spirituality combine to form a person&#39;s values and beliefs.  Whatever form they take, your values are one of the most powerful determinants of your behavior. Values also play a large role in who we feel comfortable being around and who we find attractive.  Dissimilarity in values generally causes discomfort or awkwardness in social situations.  Although close friends, family and loved ones can often have one or two stark contrasts in their values, this is made possible by a greater number of shared values, backgrounds and experiences that provide a framework of comfort and similarity.  When building an intimate relationship, establishing shared values early on is key to long-term success.

The dimensions that we consider as part of your Personal Values are Traditionalism, Spirituality, Family Goals and Altruism.</P>

			<P><STRONG>Based on your profile, you are most compatible with women who fit the following descriptions:</STRONG></P>
			<UL>
				
					
					<B>Family Background: </B>Your ideal mate will probably understand if your relationship with your family is distant, uninvolved or filled with conflict. Her own family relationships are sometimes marked by tension, miscommunication or anger, but she has learned to adapt. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Traditionalism: </B>You&#39;ll be happiest with a woman who considers herself a good person: She has strong values and her moral beliefs are an important part of who she is. She probably believes that values related to religion, country and family provide important general guidelines for life.
				
			</UL>

			<P><STRONG>Some additional details about your ideal mate:</STRONG></P>
			<UL>
				
					
					<B>Spirituality: </B>Your ideal mate isn&#39;t the kind of person who gets involved with a religious community. She generally only attends religious services for weddings and funerals, and even then she&#39;s uncomfortable with organized religion.
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Family Goals:</B>  Your ideal mate shares your desires to start a new family and experience the joys of parenthood. She loves children and expects that they will play a central role in her life. 
				
					<BR><BR>
					<B>Altruism: </B>Your ideal mate is the kind of person who cares about helping strangers but who might not spend a lot of her time doing so. She is someone who would help her friends if they asked her to. With encouragement, she might join efforts to help strangers, whether it&#39;s a canned food drive or a charity fundraiser.
