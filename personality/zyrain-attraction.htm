      You Are</SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=rptContentHdr>You're a pillar of
      strength </SPAN><BR><SPAN class=rptContent>You're a man with a very
      balanced personality and lifestyle. You believe in making room in life to
      relax, think, and have fun. You refuse to settle long-term for a boring
      job or doing something just because it's expected of you. Love is the same
      way. You know what real love feels like and you'll accept no imitations!
      You're honest, straightforward, and have lots of common sense. Because you
      don't "wear your heart on your sleeve" doesn't mean you lack deep
      feelings. In fact, you're deeply committed to your loved ones and the
      causes you believe in. Men as truly balanced as you are very rare.
      </SPAN><BR><BR><BR><SPAN class=rptContentHdr>What's dating all about to
      you? </SPAN><BR><SPAN class=rptContent>Finding a loving relationship is a
      mission for you. You have clear goals and even a timeline in mind. Falling
      in love is an especially magical experience. You're suddenly free from the
      rules and thinking that guide your life. You usually keep your feelings
      and life under control. But remember, the bigger the dam, the bigger the
      flood when it breaks! </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=rptContent>You face two
      major challenges in finding the love of your life. First, because your
      mind is so busy making sure you say and do the right things on dates, it's
      hard for your deeper and caring self to come through. It feels risky to
      share this part of yourself but most women need this emotional connection.
      Second, although having a vision of what you want can be helpful, the risk
      is that your high standards and rush to find the perfect woman can get in
      the way of loving a real-life imperfect woman. </SPAN><BR><BR><BR><SPAN

      </SPAN><BR><SPAN class=rptContent>Your personality profile is similar to a
      number of men your age. Looking at over 10,000 men who have taken the
      test, about 29.4% (or about 1 in 3 men) have very similar beliefs, values,
      and habits. Of course, the way these qualities are expressed in you is
      what makes you so unique. </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=rptContentHdr>How

      class=rptContent>Like all men, you have your strengths as well as your
      quirks and shortcomings. Ultimately, you want to find someone who will
      love and accept you "warts and all." Because you're a private person, it's
      especially important that you find a partner who understands. </SPAN><BR>
      <UL class=rptList>
        <LI id=Results1_bullet_self_quirk1>You have a pretty even-tempered
        personality and may not have any especially annoying or quirky habits.
        Of course, seeming to be "perfect" could be seen as a flaw by some, in
        which case you may just want to pretend to have a bad habit!
      </LI></UL><SPAN class=rptContentHdr>Do women like your type?
      </SPAN><BR><SPAN class=rptContent>Notice that 90% of women are generally

      a natural leader. She's smart, insightful, and willing to fight for what
      she believes in. You'll soon learn that she's a woman you can respect and
      count on to do what she says. She lives a very ordered and busy life,
      since she's always juggling her career, family and friends, and her
      involvement in community or social causes. Yet, she'll still make room for
      you in her life. You can be each other's escape from the ideas, pressures,
      and deadlines of each day. </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=rptContent>You don't
      expect your partner to be in a good mood all the time. You understand that
      sometimes your partner will be down, get pessimistic or worry too much.
      These days are balanced by the many good days the two of you will share.
      In fact, you share a number of positive qualities, including:

      combination of similarities and contrasts in personality you find
      extremely appealing. </SPAN><BR><BR><SPAN class=rptContent>However,

      other. Part of you wants to be more like her, or at least have her unique

      class=rptContent>The truth is that everyone is potentially "high

      long-term harmony is finding a woman who can tolerate (or maybe even
      enjoy) your "quirks," or the little personal oddities that make you
      unique. You seem okay with several common quirks that might come along
      with your "ideal" woman: </SPAN><BR>

        <LI id=Results1_bullet_seek_quirks1>You can enjoy her enthusiasm for new

        <LI id=Results1_bullet_seek_quirks2>You can put up with her being overly
        critical and bossy at times.
        <LI id=Results1_bullet_seek_quirks3>You can understand her career drive

      the extreme end of qualities you otherwise find appealing. So, be prepared
