      drive to unlock the secrets of nature and to develop new technologies,
      they have done much to shape the world. Your particular personality type,
      the Mastermind (INTJ), is even scarcer. Individuals of your type make up

      </B></FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
      size=2>Rationals are ingenious, independent people who can be both
      strong-willed and skeptical. Typically focused on the world of ideas,
      Rationals spend much of their time and energy understanding how things
      work. Known for being strategic leaders and skilled thinkers, Rationals
      are generally even-tempered, goal-oriented individuals who yearn for
      achievement and accomplishment. People of this temperament can make both
      reasonable mates and effective parents. Indeed they can be the kinds of
      mentors that can help their children gain confidence and independence.
      Valuing logic and pragmatism above almost all else, Rationals can
      sometimes seem cold and distant to others. It's not that they don't care
      about the people around them. It's simply that they're more oriented
      toward ingenuity and results, than toward interpersonal exploration.
      </FONT></P>

      <P align=left><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
      size=2>All Rationals are solid planners, but Masterminds are head and
      shoulders above the rest when it comes to complex operations planning.
      Your type seems to have an innate ability to grasp a project's necessary
      progression and understand how each step leads to the next. You can also
      be first-rate when it comes to anticipating potential difficulties and
      preparing alternatives. By trying to imagine every contingency, you'll
      almost never set off on a project without a more than one plan in mind. If
      Plan A fails, you'll move directly along to Plan B. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
      size=2>Although your combination of big picture thinking and
      detail-oriented skills can make you a highly capable leader, you may not
      always be eager to take command. Most times you'll prefer to stay in the
      background until it's been demonstrated that you're the only person who's
      equal to the task. Once you do agree to take charge, your kind is
      thoroughly pragmatic. Masterminds understand that efficiency is
      indispensable in a well-run organization. In fact, if you encounter
      inefficiency, you can be quick to realign operations and reassign
      personnel. Whether at work or in your personal life, you're not the type
      to feel bound by established rules or traditional procedures. Nor are you
      easily impressed by flashy trends or new buzzwords. The only ideas that
      you'll adopt in your own life or accept from others are those that truly
      make sense to you. Sometimes this decisiveness can come off as being a bit
      harsh, but often you're willing to risk that for the sake of efficiency.
      </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In
      your career, your hard work and dedication to achieving goals are likely
      to be rewarded. Masterminds in professional settings often rise to
      positions of responsibility. Once in such a position, you'll likely
      continue your goal-oriented ways, sparing neither your own time and effort
      nor that of your colleagues and employees. As a result, coworkers will
      likely come to know you as one who is highly effective, but who can also
      be a taskmaster at times. However, this doesn't mean that you're an ogre.
      Part of being effective means understanding that people work best when
      they feel good about what they're doing. In most situations, you'll
      verbalize the positive and avoid the negative; you're more interested in
      moving things forward than dwelling on mistakes of the past. </FONT></P>
      <P align=left><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
      size=2>Problem solving can be highly stimulating to Masterminds. So if
      there's a puzzle or tangled system that needs sorting out, you'll probably
      be eager to take it on. Decisions often come easily to you. In fact, at
      times you may hardly be able to rest until you have things settled and
      decided. However, even your quicker decisions are often based on some kind
      of research. You're part of a highly theoretical group, one which often
      insists on looking at all available data before embracing an idea or plan.
      You may find yourself suspicious of any statement that is either based on
      shoddy research or not checked against reality. In addition to these
      traits, it's interesting to note that Masterminds tend to be much more
      certain and self-confident than other Rationals. Although you may not
      think about it often, you likely have a well-developed strong will of your
      own that you put to use regularly. </FONT></P>

      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>People strong
      in Extraversion are typically more comfortable socializing with groups
      than being alone. They often report that they're energized by contact with
      other people. These individuals usually have a large circle of friends and
      are happy to approach others, even strangers, to talk. For people high in
      Extraversion, social banter is usually an easy and pleasant thing.
      Interaction is something that makes them feel alive. As a result, too much
      quiet and seclusion can actually exhaust such persons. They tend to report
      feelings of loneliness or power drain when not in contact with others.
      </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>On the other
      hand, people prone to Introversion often seem more comfortable alone than
      in a crowd. They tend to draw energy from private, solitary activities,
      including reading, listening to music, and working by themselves on their
      latest project or favorite hobby. Introverts usually have a few, long-time
      friends, and can remain in contact with larger groups only so long before
      their energies are depleted. If their job, family, or social
      responsibilities require them to be outgoing or take center stage, they
      can soon become exhausted and need down time in quiet places to rest and
      recharge their batteries. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Remember,
      however, that no one is simply an "Extravert" or an "Introvert." These
      terms are merely end points on the E-I scale, with most everyone falling
      somewhere in between. Most individuals embody a mixture of these two
      social styles. Also, different tasks or roles at work or in the family can
      bring out more Extraversion or Introversion in a person. This dimension of
      personality, more than the other three, is fluid and situational.

      in the world of concrete things; people with high Intuitive scores pay
      more attention to what is going on inside themselves in the abstract world
      of ideas. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Sensory
      people make up the vast majority of the population -- upwards of 85%.
      These people seem more at home in the material world, where they spend
      their time looking after the business of everyday living: food and
      clothing, transportation and shelter, job and family, recreation and
      social life. With their eye on physical realities, they tend to see all
      the particulars of what is right in front of them. They typically focus on
      what's happening in the here-and-now, or what has happened in the past,
      rather than speculating about future possibilities. These are practical,
      down-to-earth people who want facts, trust facts, and remember facts. They
      believe in common sense and usually trust that experience is the best
      teacher. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In contrast,
      people who are strongly Intuitive seem more at home in the abstract,
      conceptual world of ideas. Intuitive types deal in inferences, theories,
      daydreams, musings, speculations, and symbols -- things that can only be
      seen with the mind's eye. In fact, because they're so often focused on
      their internal world, these individuals can sometimes miss a great deal of
      what's going on around them. For highly Intuitive people, reality is not a
      solid, present thing, but is more a mental image or a stage of development
      toward some future ideal. The possible almost always looms large for
      Intuitive people: whatever "is" can be better. They can be fascinated by
      hypotheses and potentials. They are also often absorbed by their vivid and
      complex imaginations. The S-N scale measures the most fundamental of the
      four dimensions of personality. It's the first cut, so to speak, in
      evaluating one's type. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>However, this
      delineation doesn't mean that being Intuitive or Sensory is an "either-or"
      proposition. Intuitive individuals certainly turn outward at times and pay
      attention to the world at large; they're just far more inclined to become
      preoccupied with their own ideas. So too, Sensory people do sometimes look
      inward to ponder and to dream. However, for the most part their flights of
      imagination lag well behind their real-world observations. Neither type
      can occupy both worlds at once, and each will usually show a clear
      preference for one over the other. </FONT></P>

      convinced only by hard data and sound reasoning. Individuals who scored
      highly in Thinking tend to be frank and straightforward. They are the kind
      of people who are usually willing to speak their minds and stick to their
      guns, even if it causes conflict with others. They're known for being
      tough-minded in their decisions, preferring to keep emotions and desires
      out of the process as much as possible. Thinking types do have powerful
      feelings, but a strong show of emotion can embarrasses them. As a result,
      they'll usually keep their feelings in check rather than appearing to lose
      self-control, even at the risk of seeming hard-nosed or cold. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In contrast,
      people on the Feeling end of the scale are typically more comfortable
      basing their actions on personal, emotional factors. When considering
      their course, this type will consult their feelings first and will almost
      always show concern for others. For the most part, these individuals are
      sympathetic and sentimental. As a result, many times they can be swayed by
      powerful desire or a touching appeal. Feeling people tend to be
      softhearted when making decisions. They don't like to hurt anyone's
      feelings. It's not that Feeling individuals necessarily have more or
      deeper emotions than those on the Thinking end of the scale. They simply
      let their feelings show more easily. This tendency makes them seem warmer

      to these individuals, as is orderly procedure. As a result, they can be
      quick to make schedules, agendas, or timetables for themselves and others
      to follow. People strong in Judgment will establish deadlines and take
      them seriously, expecting others will do the same. They're usually
      comfortable with routines and can be willing to do all sorts of
      maintenance and cleaning up after a task, feeling that these are necessary
      steps for a job's completion. For this type, neatness counts. They usually

      part, people given to Perception keep their eyes open to what's around
      them, gathering information and looking for opportunities and alternatives

      settle on a finished product. Instead, they tend to prefer exploring
      possibilities. These individuals are often playful and spontaneous in
      action. Schedules can make them feel hurried and over-controlled; they
      tend to look upon deadlines as mere reminders to get on with the job.
      Also, People high in Perception prefer their work to be enjoyable and
      meaningful. If a task of routine maintenance or clean up falls to them,
      they may balk at doing it, or may leave it to someone else. Easy-going,

      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#003399
      size=3>What is temperament? </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>There are two
      sides to personality: One is temperament and the other is character.
      Temperament is a set of inclinations we are born with, while character is
      a set of habits we acquire as we grow and mature. Character is
      disposition, developed over a lifetime; temperament is predisposition,
      hardwired in from birth. Thus, those of the Artisan temperament are
      predisposed to impulsive action, those of the Guardian temperament to
      responsible service, those of the Idealist temperament to personal
      development, and those of the Rational temperament to objective analysis.
      Each type of person, unless blocked or deflected by an unfavorable
      environment, will develop the habits of character appropriate to his or
      her temperament. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Put another
      way, our brain is a sort of computer that has temperament for its hardware
      and character for its software. Our hardware is the physical base of our
      personality, placing on each of us an unmistakable temperament signature,
      some facets of which can be observed from a very early age. Our software
      on the other hand, is made up of our individual experience and social
      environment -- the forces around us that, with time and occasion, give
      shape to our individual character. </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Thus
      temperament is the inborn form of human nature and character is the
      emergent form that develops through the interaction of temperament and
