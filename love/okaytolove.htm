style='font-size:11.0pt'>In words which can still bring tears to the eyes, St.
Augustine describes the desolation into which the death of his friend <span
class=SpellE>Nebridius</span> plunged him <i>(Confessions </i>IV, 10). Then he
draws a moral. This is what comes, he says, of giving one's heart to anything
but God. All human beings pass away. Do not let your happiness depend on
something you may lose. If love is to be a blessing, not a misery, it must be <i>for
</i>the only Beloved who will never pass away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.0pt;line-height:
13.9pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><i><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Of </span></i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>course
this is excellent sense. Don't put your goods in a leaky vessel. Don't spend
too much on a house you may be turned out of. And there is no man alive who
responds more naturally than I to such canny maxims. I am a safety-first
creature. <i>Of </i>all arguments against love none makes so strong an appeal
to my nature as &quot;Careful! This might lead you to suffering.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.15in;line-height:
13.9pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>To my nature, my temperament, yes. Not to my con­science.
When I respond to that appeal I seem to myself to be a thousand miles away from
Christ. If I am <i>sure </i>of anything I am <i>sure </i>that His teaching was
never meant to confirm my congenital preference <i>for </i>safe investments and
limited liabilities. I doubt whether there is anything in me that pleases Him
less. And who could conceivably begin to love God on such a prudential
ground-because the security <i>(so </i>to speak) is better? Who could even
include it among the grounds <i>for </i>loving? Would you choose a wife or a
Friend-if it comes to that, would you choose a dog-in this spirit? One must be
outside the world of love, of all loves, before one thus calculates. Eros,
lawless Eros, preferring the Beloved to happiness, is more like Love <span
class=GramE>himself</span> than this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:13.2pt;line-height:
13.9pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>I think that this passage in the <i>Confessions </i>is
less a part of St. Augustine's Christendom than a hangover from the high-minded
Pagan philosophies in which he grew up. It is closer to Stoic
&quot;apathy&quot; or neo-Platonic mysticism than to charity. We follow One who
wept over Jerusalem and at the grave of Lazarus, and, loving all, yet had one
disciple whom, in a special sense, he &quot;loved.&quot; St. Paul has a higher
authority with us than St. Augustine-St. Paul who shows no sign that he would
not have suffered like a man, and no feeling that he ought not so to have suffered,
if <span class=SpellE>Epaphroditus</span> had died <i>(Phil. </i>II, 27).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:12.45pt;line-height:
13.9pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Even if it were granted that insurances against heart­break
were <i>our </i>highest wisdom, does God Himself offer them? <span class=GramE>Apparently
not.</span> Christ comes at last to say &quot;Why hast thou forsaken me?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.5pt;line-height:
13.9pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>There is no escape along the lines St. Augustine sug­gests.
<span class=GramE>Nor along any other lines.</span> There is no safe in­vestment.
To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will
certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make <i>sure </i>of
keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not even to an animal.
Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all
entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But
in that casket-safe, dark, motionless, airless-it will change. It will not be
broken; it will become unbreakable, im­penetrable, <span class=GramE>irredeemable</span>.
The alternative to tragedy, or at <span class=GramE>least</span> to the risk of
tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside Heaven where you can be perfectly
safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:11.0pt;line-height:
13.9pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>I believe that the most lawless and inordinate loves
are less contrary to God's will than a self-invited and self-­protective <span
class=SpellE>lovelessness</span>. It is like hiding the talent in a napkin and
for much the same reason &quot;I knew thee that thou wert a hard man.&quot;
Christ did not teach and suffer that we might become, even in the natural
loves, more careful of our own happiness. If a man is not uncalcu­lating
towards the earthly beloveds whom he has seen, he is none the more likely to be
so towards God whom he has not. We shall draw nearer to God, not by trying to
avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves, but by ac­cepting them and offering
them to Him; throwing away all defensive <span class=SpellE>armour</span>. If
our hearts need to be broken, and if He chooses this as the way in which they
should break, so be it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;line-height:13.9pt;mso-pagination:
none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:
11.0pt'>It remains certainly true that all natural loves can be inordinate. <i>Inordinate
</i>does not mean &quot;insufficiently cautious.&quot; Nor does it mean
&quot;too big.&quot; It is not a quan­titative term. It is probably impossible
to love any human being simply &quot;too much.&quot; We may love him too much <i>in
proportion </i>to our love for God; but it is the smallness of our love for
God, not the greatness of our love for the man, that constitutes the
inordinacy. But even this must be refined upon. Otherwise we shall trouble some
who are very much on the right road but alarmed because they cannot feel
towards God so warm a sensible emo­tion as they feel for the earthly Beloved.
It is much to be wished-at least I think so-that we all, at all times, could.
We must pray that this gift should be given us. But the question whether we are
loving God or the earthly Beloved &quot;more&quot; is not, so far as concerns
our Christian duty, a question about the comparative inten­sity of two
feelings. The real question is, which (when the alternative comes) do you
serve, or choose, or put first? To which claim does your will, in the last
resort, yield?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:12.95pt;line-height:
13.9pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>As so often, Our Lord's own words are both far fiercer
and far more tolerable than those of the theologians. He says nothing about
guarding against earthly loves for fear we might be hurt; He says something
that cracks like a whip about trampling them all under foot the moment they
hold us back from following Him. &quot;If any man come to me and hate not his
father and mother and wife...and his own life also, he cannot be my dis­ciple&quot;
<i>(Luke </i>XIV, 26).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:12.7pt;line-height:
13.9pt;mso-pagination:none;mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none'>But
how are we to understand the word <i>hate? </i>That Love Himself should be
commanding what we ordinarily mean by hatred-commanding us to cherish
resentment, to gloat over another's misery, to delight in injuring him-is
almost a contradiction in terms. I think Our Lord, in the sense here intended, <span
class=GramE>&quot;</span>hated&quot; St. Peter when he said, &quot;Get thee
behind me.&quot; To hate is to reject, to set one's face against, to make no
concession to, the Beloved when the Beloved utters, however sweetly and however
pitiably, the suggestions of the Devil. A man, said Jesus, who tries to serve
two masters, will &quot;hate&quot; the one and &quot;love&quot; the other. It
is <span class=GramE>not,</span> surely, mere feelings of aversion and liking
that are here in question. He will adhere to, consent to, <span class=GramE>work</span>
for, the one and not for the other.</p>
